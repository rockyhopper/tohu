<h2>departure-example</h2>
<p>An example of an airport departure card.</p>
<p>Covers: data validation, using Group for layout, displaying dynamic images</p>
<p>Note: this example was actually written as a test of how productive this technology is.  The author wrote the rules in 1 hour and then a UI developer (who doesn't know the underlying technology) spent another 1 hour making it look nice using CSS.  The example (and the original <a href="http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/quest/sddquest.nsf/12df43879eb9b25e4c256809001ee0fe/9226dae2ca1cf9564c2569650002caeb/$FILE/NZ%20Passenger%20Departure%20Card%20-%20Mar%202007.pdf" target="_blank">paper version</a> from which it was modelled) includes 5 separate branching points.</p>

<h2>genealogy-example</h2>
<p>A simple family tree example.</p>
<p>Covers: multiple copies of the same question with different ids, custom javascript to present a boolean question as an icon.</p>

<h2>loyalty-card-examples</h2>
<p>3 examples of increasing complexity which build up a ficticious Solnet Loyalty Card.</p>
<ul>
  <li>simple - single page with some dynamic behaviour</li>
  <li>medium - multiple pages and more dynamic behaviour, multiple skins/brands using different CSS on the same rules, custom javascript to present a note as a progress bar</li>
  <li>complex - joint account (reuse of question rules), other loyalty programs (page branching), custom answerType to aid validation</li>
  <li style="color:red">complete - it would be nice to extend this into a compete end-to-end working application by adding persistence so you can enter your name and it opens your record allowing you to edit the fields (but with some readonly).</li>
</ul>
